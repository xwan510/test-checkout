## About The Project
A test Node JS project. spent 3 hours-ish.
Discount rules can be added to pricing_rules as classes.

## Things to improve
* Rounding and verifying arithmetic calculation accuracy.
* Efficiency when applying the rules. Those loops code in rules can be optimised.
* Typescript to enforce strict typing.
* No need to Classify eCommerce items, in real life scenario, the items data comes from DB, they look generic enough.
